# What's New in Data Migration Assistant v3.1

Data Migration Assistant v3.1 is a minor version update and includes following additions:

- Improved assessment recommendations for Azure SQL Databases around database collations, use of unsupported system stored procedures, and CLR objects.

- Added assessment guidance for compatibility levels 130, 120, 110 and 100 migrating to Azure SQL Databases.

Data Migration Assistant enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server. Data Migration Assistant recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment, and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.
