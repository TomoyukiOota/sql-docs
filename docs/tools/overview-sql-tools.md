# Tools and utilities for Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, and SQL Data Warehouse

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all_md](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]  

![](../includes/media/sql-database-tools.png) This article provides a list of available tools for working with SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, SQL Data Warehouse, and SQL Server-based applications. 

If you want to jump right in and start creating tables, running queries, basically design and manage your database, then [**SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) is most likely your go-to tool. SSMS is free, and runs on Windows.

If you're running Linux or macOS, try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [**mssql for Visual Studio Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension. These tools are for developing Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse with a rich set of functionalities, and are also free. See [Use Visual Studio Code to create and run Transact-SQL scripts for SQL Server](../linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode.md).


## SQL tools
