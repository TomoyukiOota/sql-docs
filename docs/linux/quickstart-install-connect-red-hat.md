# Install SQL Server and create a database on Red Hat

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only](../includes/tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only.md)]

In this quick start tutorial, you first install SQL Server 2017 RC2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.3. Then connect with **sqlcmd** to create your first database and run queries.

> [!TIP]
> This tutorial requires user input and an internet connection. If you are interested in the [unattended](sql-server-linux-setup.md#unattended) or [offline](sql-server-linux-setup.md#offline) installation procedures, see [Installation guidance for SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup.md).

## Prerequisites

You must have a RHEL 7.3 machine with **at least 3.25 GB** of memory.

To install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on your own machine, go to [http://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation](http://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation). You can also create RHEL virtual machines in Azure. See [Create and Manage Linux VMs with the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm), and use `--image RHEL` in the call to `az vm create`.

For other system requirements, see [System requirements for SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup.md#system).

## <a id="install"></a>Install SQL Server

To configure SQL Server on RHEL, run the following commands in a terminal to install the **mssql-server** package:

1. Download the Microsoft SQL Server Red Hat repository configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/mssql-server.repo
   ```

1. Run the following commands to install SQL Server:

   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   sudo yum install -y mssql-server
   ```

1. After the package installation finishes, run **mssql-conf setup** and follow the prompts to set the SA password and chose your edition.

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```
   > [!TIP]
   > Make sure to specify a strong password for the SA account (Minimum length 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, base 10 digits and/or non-alphanumeric symbols).

   > [!TIP]
   > When installing RC2, no purchased licenses are required to try any of the editions. Because it is a release candidate, the following message appears regardless of the edition you select:
   >
   > `This is an evaluation version.  There are [175] days left in the evaluation period.`
   >
   > This message does not reflect the edition you selected. It relates to the preview period for RC2.

1. Once the configuration is done, verify that the service is running:

   ```bash
   systemctl status mssql-server
   ```
   
1. To allow remote connections, open the SQL Server port on the firewall on RHEL. The default SQL Server port is TCP 1433. If you are using **FirewallD** for your firewall, you can use the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=1433/tcp --permanent
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

At this point, SQL Server is running on your RHEL machine and is ready to use!

## <a id="tools"></a>Install the SQL Server command-line tools

To create a database, you need to connect with a tool that can run Transact-SQL statements on the SQL Server. The following steps install the SQL Server command-line tools: [sqlcmd](../tools/sqlcmd-utility.md) and [bcp](../tools/bcp-utility.md).

1. Download the Microsoft Red Hat repository configuration file.

   ```bash
   sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/msprod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo
   ```

1. If you had a previous version of **mssql-tools** installed, remove any older unixODBC packages.

   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   sudo yum remove unixODBC-utf16 unixODBC-utf16-devel
   ```

1. Run the following commands to install **mssql-tools** with the unixODBC developer package.

   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   sudo yum install -y mssql-tools unixODBC-devel
   ```

1. For convenience, add `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/` to your **PATH** environment variable. This enables you to run the tools without specifying the full path. Run the following commands to modify the **PATH** for both login sessions and interactive/non-login sessions:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

> [!TIP]
> **Sqlcmd** is just one tool for connecting to SQL Server to run queries and perform management and development tasks. Other tools include [SQL Server Management Studio](sql-server-linux-develop-use-ssms.md) and [Visual Studio Code](sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode.md).
