# Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only](../includes/tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only.md)]

This topic describes how to run SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages on Linux. SSIS solves complex data integration problems by loading data from multiple sources and formats, transforming and cleansing the data, and updating multiple destinations. 

SSIS packages running on Linux can connect to Microsoft SQL Server running on Windows on-premises or in the cloud, on Linux, or in Docker. They can also connect to Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and ODBC data sources.

You can use SSIS to run packages on Linux when you also have a Windows computer to create and maintain packages. The SSIS design and management tools are Windows applications. 

## Prerequisites

To run SSIS packages on a Linux computer, first you have to install SQL Server Integration Services. For installation instructions, see [Install SQL Server Integration Services](sql-server-linux-setup-ssis.md).

## Run an SSIS package

To run an SSIS package on a Linux computer, do the following things:

1.  Copy the SSIS package to the Linux computer.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```
    $ dtexec /F \<package name \> /DE <protection password>
    ```

## More about SSIS on Linux

**ODBC connections**. With SSIS on Linux CTP 2.1 Refresh and later, SSIS packages can use ODBC connections on Linux. This functionality has been tested with the SQL Server and the MySQL ODBC drivers, but is also expected to work with any Unicode ODBC driver that observes the ODBC specification. At design time, you can provide either a DSN or a connection string to connect to the ODBC data; you can also use Windows authentication. For more info, see the [blog post announcing ODBC support on Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssis/2017/06/16/odbc-is-supported-in-ssis-on-linux-ssis-helsinki-ctp2-1-refresh/).

**Paths**. SSIS on Linux does not support Linux-style paths, but maps Windows-style paths to Linux-style paths at run time. Provide Windows-style paths in your SSIS packages. Then, for example, SSIS on Linux maps the Windows-style path `C:\test` to the Linux-style path `/test`.

**Deploying packages**. You can only store packages in the file system on Linux in this release. The SSIS Catalog database and the legacy SSIS service are not available on Linux for package deployment and storage.

**Scheduling packages**. You can't use SQL Agent on Linux to schedule package execution in this release.

**Other limitations and known issues**. The following features are not supported in this release when you run SSIS packages on Linux:
  - SSIS Catalog database
  - Scheduled package execution by SQL Agent
  - Windows Authentication
  - Third-party components
  - Change Data Capture (CDC)
  - SSIS Scale Out
  - Azure Feature Pack for SSIS
  - Hadoop and HDFS support
  - Microsoft Connector for SAP BW

For other limitations and known issues with SSIS on Linux, see the [Release Notes](sql-server-linux-release-notes.md#ssis).

## More about SSIS

Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is a platform for building high-performance data integration solutions, including extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) packages for data warehousing. For more info about SSIS, see [SQL Server Integration Services](/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services.md).

SSIS includes the following features:
- graphical tools and wizards for building and debugging packages on Windows
- a variety of tasks for performing workflow functions such as FTP operations, executing SQL statements, and sending e-mail messages
- a variety of data sources and destinations for extracting and loading data
- a variety of transformations for cleaning, aggregating, merging, and copying data
- application programming interfaces (APIs) for extending SSIS with your own custom scripts and components

To get started with SSIS, download the latest version of [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md). Then follow the tutorial [SSIS How to Create an ETL Package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms169917.aspx).
